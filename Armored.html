                <p>Medium tanks are larger, have thicker armor, and have more firepower than light tanks, making them more suited
                    for manuvore warfare and tank on tank engagments. They are however more expensive than light tanks.

                <p>Heavy tanks are meant for breaking through enemy line and creating gaps for other units to exploit. For this reason
                    they are heavily armed and armored, which makes them very expensive.

                <p>Modern tanks are the pinicle of tank development by combining the speed of medium tanks with the firepower and 
                    armor protection of heavy tanks. They are however expensive to produce and take a long time to research.
