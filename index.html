                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Hearts of Iron IV is a grand strategy game that allows you to take control on any nations in 1936 or 1939 and
                    control it to recreate World War 2 or reshape history to your liking. This game was created by Paradox Development
                    Studio and published by Paradox Interactive. It features both single player and multiplayer modes. The main focus
                    is in the military, which consists of the Army, Navy, and Airforce. All three of these branches of the military are
                    crucial in helping nations win wars against other, so it is important for the player to understand all three to
                    efficiently utilize them.
